Penelope can be run on all Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS, FreeBSD etc) and requires **Python 3.6+**

It requires no installation as it uses only Python’s standard library - just download and execute the script:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brightio/penelope/refs/heads/main/penelope.py && python3 penelope.py
```
For a more streamlined setup, it can be installed using pipx:
```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/brightio/penelope
```

Penelope can work in conjunction with metasploit exploits by disabling the default handler with `set DisablePayloadHandler True`

## Usage
### Sample Typical Usage
```
penelope                          # Listening for reverse shells on 0.0.0.0:4444
penelope -p 5555                  # Listening for reverse shells on 0.0.0.0:5555
penelope -i eth0 -p 5555          # Listening for reverse shells on eth0:5555
penelope -a                       # Listening for reverse shells on 0.0.0.0:4444 and show reverse shell payloads based on the current Listeners

penelope -c target -p 3333        # Connect to a bind shell on target:3333

penelope ssh user@target          # Get a reverse shell from target on local port 4444
penelope -p 5555 ssh user@target  # Get a reverse shell from target on local port 5555
penelope -i eth0 -p 5555 -- ssh -l user -p 2222 target  # Get a reverse shell from target on eth0, local port 5555 (use -- if ssh needs switches)

penelope -s <File/Folder>         # Share a file or folder via HTTP
```

### Demonstrating Random Usage

As shown in the below video, within only a few seconds we have easily:
1. A fully functional auto-resizable PTY shell while logging every interaction with the target
2. Execute the lastest version of Linpeas on the target without touching the disk and get the output on a local file in realtime 
3. One more PTY shell in another tab
4. Uploaded the latest versions of LinPEAS and linux-smart-enumeration
5. Uploaded a local folder with custom scripts
6. Uploaded an exploit-db exploit directly from URL
7. Downloaded and opened locally a remote file
8. Downloaded the remote /etc directory
9. For every shell that may be killed for some reason, automatically a new one is spawned. This gives us a kind of persistence with the target

### Main Menu Commands
Some Notes:
- By default you need to press `F12` to detach the PTY shell and go to the Main Menu. If the upgrade was not possible the you ended up with a basic shell, you can detach it with `Ctrl+C`. This also prevents the accidental killing of the shell.
- The Main Menu supports TAB completion and also short commands. For example instead of `interact 1` you can just type `i 1`.

## TODO

### Features
* remote port forwarding
* socks & http proxy
* persistence modules
* team server
* currently spawn/script/portfwd commands are supported only on Unix shells. Those need to be implemented for Windows shells too.
* an option switch for disable all logging, not only sessions.
* main menu autocompletion for short commands
* download/upload autocompletion
* IPv6 support
* encryption
* UDP support

## FAQ

### ► Is Penelope allowed in OSCP exam?
Yes since it doesn't do any auto-exploitation.

### ► How can I go from the shell to the Main Menu?
It depends on the upgrade that is taken place.

- PTY shells escape key: `F12`
- Readline: EOF (`Ctrl-D`)
- Raw: SIGINT (`Ctrl-C`)

In any case you can see it once you attach to a session. For example:
<img width="597" height="56" alt="463710291-51ee6370-7952-4db1-a0fd-31572278fa8e" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36b53c73-48cb-4ba7-a36a-ea92d1ea8f9b" />

### ► How can I change the menu key?
For example to change the PTY escape key from `F12` to `Ctrl-P`, put the following in `~/.penelope/peneloperc`:

`self.escape = {'sequence':b'\x10', 'key':'Ctrl+P'}`

### ► How can I contribute?
Your contributions are invaluable! If you’d like to help, please report bugs, unexpected behaviors, or share new ideas. You can also submit pull requests but avoid making commits from IDEs that enforce PEP8 and unintentionally restructure the entire codebase.

### ► How come the name?
Penelope was the wife of Odysseus and she is known for her fidelity for him by waiting years. Since a characteristic of reverse shell handlers is waiting, this tool is named after her.
