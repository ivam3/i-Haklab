Concept behind Seeker is simple, just like we host phishing pages to get credentials why not host a fake page that requests your loction just like many popular location based websites.

Seeker Hosts a fake website on **In Built PHP Server** and uses **Ngrok**, website asks for Location Permission and if the user allows it, we can get :

* Longitude
* Latitude
* Accuracy
* Altitude - Not always available
* Direction - Only available if user is moving
* Speed - Only available if user is moving

Along with Location Information we also get **Device Information** without any permissions :

* Operating System
* Platform
* Number of CPU Cores
* Amount of RAM - Approximate Results
* Screen Resolution
* GPU information
* Browser Name and Version
* Public IP Address

**This tool is a Proof of Concept and is for Educational Purposes Only, Seeker shows what data a malicious website can gather about you and your devices and why you should not click on random links and allow critical permissions such as Location etc.**

* Other tools and services offer IP Geolocation which is not very accurate and does not give location of user.

* Generally if a user accepts location permsission, Accuracy of the information recieved is **accurate to approximately 30 meters**.

**Note** : On iPhone due to some reason location accuracy is approximately 65 meters.

> If you are unable to get ngrok url that means ngrok is unable to resolve dns, switch to Mobile Data instead of WiFi and it should work, this is a problem with ngrok.
