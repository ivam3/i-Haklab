# Process during installation

i-Haklab will ......
- check if your android device has some root, if so, it will install the sudo command.
- check if termux has permission to access the external memory, thus, in there it will create a directory called 'tools' and there will install the tools and/or frameworks. otherwise they will be installed in the directory /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/share/tools. By the way, in case of Termux is installed in a second partition of your external memory those will be in /data/sdext2/data/com.termux/files/use/share/tools.
- i-Haklab has more than 80 tools of which only the main ones are installed (15) with a total weight of 3.9GB. -DoS-A-Tool -ExiF -Binchecker -Blackbox -Crunch -Torvpn -Tmate -Evilurl -Translate -Metasploit -EMBED -Java -Hydra -XHydra -Wireshark -Nmap -H8mail -Objection So, you can see the list of all tools available under the command:

        ]> i-Haklab list

- The rest of the tools can be installed or uninstalled by:

        ]> i-Haklab install/remove <name of tools>

- Either install or uninstall all at once:

        ]> i-Haklab install/remove alltools

- Once tools/frameworks installation ended the OMF shell configuration will the next. on it, i-Haklab will activate the OMF shell, and you will notice it when a welcome message to the new shell appears ... when this happens you will have to wait 2min and execute the command "exit "for the continuation of its installation.

- At the end of its installation you will only have to restart Termux and it will show an loggin screen asking you for the access key, which by default will be "Ivam3byCinderella", and can be modified from its configuration menu that is shown when using "IbyC" as the access key.

# COMMANDS

There are several commands in i-Haklab that facilitate the use of Termux:

- i-Haklab: it is the main command that helps to update and use i-Haklab with automations of various processes such as the installation/uninstallation of tools, visualization of user guides for the tools, download of hacking books, access to the community tutorials, payload creation automation, metaploit handler activation, brute force attacks among others.

- run: facilitates the execution of all external tools adapted to Termux by i-Haklab. Termux natives such as nmap run directly.
