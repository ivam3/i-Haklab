ClamAV
Maeve, the ClamAV mascot

ClamAV is an open source (GPLv2) anti-virus toolkit, designed especially for e-mail scanning on mail gateways. It provides a number of utilities including a flexible and scalable multi-threaded daemon, a command line scanner and advanced tool for automatic database updates. The core of the package is an anti-virus engine available in a form of shared library.

Tip: ClamAV is not a traditional anti-virus or endpoint security suite. For a fully featured modern endpoint security suite, check out Cisco Secure Endpoint. See "related products", below, for more details.

ClamAV is brought to you by Cisco Systems, Inc.

Community Projects
ClamAV has a diverse ecosystem of community projects, products, and other tools that either depend on ClamAV to provide malware detection capabilities or supplement ClamAV with new features such as improved support for 3rd party signature databases, graphical user interfaces (GUI), and more.

Features:

ClamAV is designed to scan files quickly.

Real time protection (Linux only). The ClamOnAcc client for the ClamD scanning daemon provides on-access scanning on modern versions of Linux. This includes an optional capability to block file access until a file has been scanned (on-access prevention).

ClamAV detects millions of viruses, worms, trojans, and other malware, including Microsoft Office macro viruses, mobile malware, and other threats.

ClamAV's bytecode signature runtime, powered by either LLVM or our custom bytecode interpreter, allows the ClamAV signature writers to create and distribute very complex detection routines and remotely enhance the scannerâ€™s functionality.

Signed signature databases ensure that ClamAV will only execute trusted signature definitions.

ClamAV scans within archives and compressed files but also protects against archive bombs. Built-in archive extraction capabilities include:

Zip (including SFX, excluding some newer or more complex extensions)
RAR (including SFX, most versions)
7Zip
ARJ (including SFX)
Tar
CPIO
Gzip

Recommended System Requirements
The following minimum recommended system requirements are for using ClamScan or ClamD applications with the standard ClamAV signature database provided by Cisco.

Minimum recommended RAM for ClamAV:

FreeBSD and Linux server edition: 2 GiB+
Linux non-server edition: 2 GiB+
Windows 7 & 10 32-bit: 2 GiB+
Windows 7 & 10 64-bit: 3 GiB+
macOS: 3 GiB+
Minimum recommended CPU for ClamAV:

1 CPU at 2.0 Ghz+
Minimum available hard disk space required:

For the ClamAV application we recommend having 5 GB of free space available. This recommendation is in addition to the recommended disk space for each OS.

Note: The tests to determine these minimum requirements were performed on systems that were not running other applications. If other applications are being run on the system, additional resources will be required in addition to our recommended minimums.

## DAEMON

ClamD
clamd is a multi-threaded daemon that uses libclamav to scan files for viruses. Scanning behavior can be fully configured to fit most needs by modifying clamd.conf.

As clamd requires a virus signature database to run, we recommend setting up ClamAV's official signatures before running clamd using freshclam.

The daemon works by listening for commands on the sockets specified in clamd.conf. Listening is supported over both unix local sockets and TCP sockets.

IMPORTANT: clamd does not currently protect or authenticate traffic coming over the TCP socket, meaning it will accept any and all of the following commands listed from any source. Thus, we strongly recommend following best networking practices when setting up your clamd instance. I.e. don't expose your TCP socket to the Internet.

Here is a quick list of the commands accepted by clamd over the socket.

PING
VERSION
RELOAD
SHUTDOWN
SCAN file/directory
RAWSCAN file/directory
CONTSCAN file/directory
MULTISCAN file/directory
ALLMATCHSCAN file/directory
INSTREAM
FILDES
STATS
IDSESSION, END
As with most ClamAV tools, you can find out more about these by invoking the command:


man clamd
The daemon also handles the following signals as so:

SIGTERM - perform a clean exit
SIGHUP - reopen the log file
SIGUSR2 - reload the database
It should be noted that clamd should not be started using the shell operator & or other external tools which would start it as a background process. Instead, you should run clamd which will load the database and then daemonize itself (unless you have specified otherwise in clamd.conf). After that, clamd is ready to accept connections and perform file scanning.

Once you have set up your configuration to your liking, and understand how you will be sending commands to the daemon, running clamd itself is simple. Simply execute the command:


clamd
ClamDScan
clamdscan is a clamd client, which greatly simplifies the task of scanning files with clamd. It sends commands to the clamd daemon across the socket specified in clamd.conf and generates a scan report after all requested scanning has been completed by the daemon.

Thus, to run clamdscan, you must have an instance of clamd already running as well.

Please keep in mind, that as a simple scanning client, clamdscan cannot change scanning and engine configurations. These are tied to the clamd instance and the configuration you set up in clamd.conf. Therefore, while clamdscan will accept many of the same commands as its sister tool clamscan, it will simply ignore most of them as (by design) no mechanism exists to make ClamAV engine configuration changes over the clamd socket.

Again, running clamdscan, once you have a working clamd instance, is simple:


clamdscan [*options*] [*file/directory/-*]
ClamDTop
clamdtop is a tool to monitor one or multiple instances of clamd. It has a colorized ncurses interface, which shows each job queued, memory usage, and information about the loaded signature database for the connected clamd instance(s). By default it will attempt to connect to the local clamd as defined in clamd.conf. However, you can specify other clamd instances at the command line.

To learn more, use the commands


man clamdtop
or


clamdtop --help
On-Access Scanning
The ClamOnAcc application provides On-Access Scanning for Linux systems. On-Access Scanning is a form of real-time protection that uses ClamD to scan files when they're accessed.

ClamOnAcc (v0.102+)
ClamAV's On-Access Scanning (clamonacc) is a client that runs in its own application alongside, but separately from the clamd instance. The On-Access Scanner is capable of preventing access to/from any malicious files it discovers--based on the verdict it receives from clamd--but by default it is configured to run in notify-only mode, which means it will simply alert the user if a malicious file is detected, then take any additional actions that the user may have specified at the command line, but it will not actively prevent processes from reading or writing to that file.

Disclaimer: Enabling Prevention mode will seriously impact performance if used on commonly accessed directories.

Tip: You can run ClamOnAcc multiple times simultaneously, each with a different config. If you want to enable Prevention-mode for one directory, while sticking to notify-only mode for any other monitored directories, that's an option!

On-Access Scanning is primarily set up through clamd.conf. However, you can learn more about all the configuration and command line options available to you by reading the On-Access Scanning User Guide.

Once you have set up the On-Access Scanner (and clamd) to your liking, you will first need to run clamd before you can start it. If your clamd instance is local, it is required you run clamd as a user that is excluded (via OnAccessExcludeUname or OnAccessExcludeUID) from On-Access scanning events (e.g.) to prevent clamonacc from triggering events endlessly as it sends scan requests to clamd:


su - clamav -c "/usr/local/bin/clamd
After the daemon is running, you can start the On-Access Scanner. clamonacc must be run as root in order to utilize its kernel event detection and intervention features:


sudo clamonacc
It will run a number of startup checks to test for a sane configuration, and ensure it can connect to clamd, and if everything checks out clamonacc will automatically fork to the background and begin monitoring your system for events.

ClamD (v0.101)
In older versions, ClamAV's On-Access Scanner is a thread that runs within a clamd instance. The On-Access Scanner is capable of blocking access to/from any malicious files it discovers--based on the verdict it finds using the engine it shares with clamd--but by default it is configured to run in notify-only mode, which means it will simply alert the user if a malicious file is detected, but it will not actively prevent processes from reading or writing to that file.

On-Access Scanning is primarily set up through clamd.conf. However, you can learn more about all the configuration and command line options available to you by reading the On-Access Scanning User Guide.

Once you have set up the On-Access Scanner to your liking, you will need to run clamd with elevated permissions to start it.


sudo clamd
One-Time Scanning
ClamScan
clamscan is a command line tool which uses libclamav to scan files and/or directories for viruses. Unlike clamdscan, clamscan does not require a running clamd instance to function. Instead, clamscan will create a new engine and load in the virus database each time it is run. It will then scan the files and/or directories specified at the command line, create a scan report, and exit.

By default, when loading databases, clamscan will check the location to which freshclam installed the virus database signatures. This behavior, along with a myriad of other scanning and engine controls, can be modified by providing flags and other options at the command line.

There are too many options to list all of them here. So we'll only cover a few common and more interesting ones:

--log=FILE - save scan report to FILE
--database=FILE/DIR - load virus database from FILE or load all supported db files from DIR
--official-db-only[=yes/no(*)] - only load official signatures
--max-filesize=#n - files larger than this will be skipped and assumed clean
--max-scansize=#n - the maximum amount of data to scan for each container file
--leave-temps[=yes/no(*)]- do not remove temporary files
--file-list=FILE - scan files from FILE
--quiet - only output error messages
--bell - sound bell on virus detection
--cross-fs[=yes(*)/no] - scan files and directories on other filesystems
--move=DIRECTORY - move infected files into DIRECTORY
--copy=DIRECTORY - copy infected files into DIRECTORY
--bytecode-timeout=N - set bytecode timeout (in milliseconds)
--heuristic-alerts[=yes(*)/no] - toggles heuristic alerts
--alert-encrypted[=yes/no(*)] - alert on encrypted archives and documents
--nocerts - disable authenticode certificate chain verification in PE files
--disable-cache - disable caching and cache checks for hash sums of scanned files
To learn more about the options available when using clamscan please reference:


man clamscan
and


clamscan --help
Otherwise, the general usage of clamscan is:


clamscan [options] [file/directory/-]
Some basic scans
Run this to scan the files in the current directory:


clamscan .
This will scan the current directory. At the end of the scan, it will display a summary. If you notice in the clamscan output, it only scanned something like 60 files, even though there are more files in subdirectories. By default, clamscan will only scan files in the current directory.

Run this to scan all the files in the current directory:


clamscan --recursive .
Run this to scan ALL the files on your system, it will take quite a while. Keep in mind that you can cancel it at any time by pressing Ctrl-C:

Linux/Unix:


clamscan --recursive /
Windows:


clamscan.exe --recursive C:\
Process Memory Scanning
Note: This feature requires Windows and ClamAV version 0.105 or newer. You must also be running ClamAV as Administrator.

clamscan and clamdscan are able to scan the virtual memory of currently executing processes. To do so, use the --memory option:


clamscan --memory
The --kill and --unload options allow for killing/unloading infected loaded modules.

Disclaimers
Disclaimer: ClamAV doesn't have a "quick scan" mode. ClamAV is malware detection toolkit, not an endpoint security suite. It's up to you to decide what to scan. A full system scan is going to take a long time with ClamAV or with any anti-virus software.

Disclaimer 2: ClamScan, ClamOnAcc, and ClamDScan each include --remove options for deleting any file which alerts during a scan. This is generally a terrible idea, unless you're monitoring an upload/downloads directory. False positives happen! You do not want to have the wrong file accidentally deleted. Instead, consider using --move or perhaps just --copy and set up script with the ClamD VirusEvent feature to notify you when something has been detected.

Windows-specific Issues
Globbing
Since the Windows command prompt doesn't take care of wildcard expansion, minimal emulation of unix glob() is performed internally. It supports * and ? only.

File paths
Please always use the backslash as the path separator. SMB Network shares and UNC paths are supported.

Socket and libclamav API Input
The Windows version of ClamAV requires all the input to be UTF-8 encoded.

This affects:

The API, notably the cl_scanfile() function
ClamD socket input, e.g. the commands SCAN, CONTSCAN, MUTLISCAN, etc.
ClamD socket output, i.e replies to the above queries
For legacy reasons ANSI (i.e. CP_ACP) input will still be accepted and processed as before, but with two important remarks:

Socket replies to ANSI queries will still be UTF-8 encoded.
ANSI sequences which are also valid UTF-8 sequences will be handled as UTF-8.
As a side note, console output (stdin and stderr) will always be OEM encoded, even when redirected to a file.
